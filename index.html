            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the journey of coding, discovery, and relentless curiosity, 
            I’m a computer science student deeply rooted in the art and science 
            of technology. I spend my days not just learning but embracing 
            the relentless pursuit of knowledge, whether it’s through group 
            projects, thesis research, or late-night coding marathons. 
            My vision is to become a software engineer—one who not only 
            understands the intricacies of code but also the essence of 
            innovation.

            Behind the projects and assignments, 
            I’m a passionate builder. I find joy in turning concepts into reality, 
            like the cake shop web application I crafted from scratch
            — <b>PASTELCO</b> —where I spent countless sleepless nights 
            refining each detail, pouring everything I had into every 
            line of code. My drive extends beyond academia; I’m an 
            executive member (Chairperson) of IEEE CS BRAC University SBC - and 
            the Publication Coordinator of the IEEE Computer Society Bangladesh 
            Team SPARK, striving to inspire others in the tech community. 
            From organizing events like 'Full-Stack Development with MERN' to 
            setting up community platforms for academic support, 
            my aim is to create a space where knowledge flows 
            freely and curiosity never stops.
            
            I also love the thrill of the quantum 
            realm, having secured a spot in QClass24/25, 
            eager to expand my horizons into the field of 
            Quantum Machine Learning.
            
            This is me, standing at the crossroad of code, 
            creativity, and endless possibilities, crafting a future 
            where technology and imagination intertwine.

        <p>
            Outside of my academic and professional world, I’m a storyteller. 
            My detective novel, like <a href="https://www.rokomari.com/book/212206/rohoshomoy-chirkut"><b>The Domicile of Mystery</b></a>, weave 
            together the threads of thriller, mystery, and murdure. 
            Writing lets me dive into ideas that transcend my immediate 
            reality, especially as I aspire to write a the 2nd novel of 
            The Domicile of Mystery.
